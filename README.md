Your experimental nano-ship is a revolution in miniaturization technology, but your latest test run has gone too far. Lost in the quantum field with your ship’s charge depleting, your only hope is to absorb the energy from the roaming particles, figuring out which energy source will help you best to overcharge your nano-ship, and to make one last attempt to rejoin the regular-sized world.

Setup

All blinks start as particles in the quantum field. Separate all Blinks (at least 6 recommended) from each other and spread them across your play area. Long-press one Blink to turn it into your nano-ship. The nano-ship will show your remaining energy as a circular gauge, which is depleting as time passes. 

Gameplay

Attach your nano-ship to any particle to collapse the particle into its revealed state. The particle will reveal different sources of energy as different colors on some of its faces. It will stay revealed while your ship is attached, but will lose coherence and return to the quantum foam, if you disconnect from it for too long, or if you connect to two particles at the same time. 

Connect your ship to a colored face of a particle and click the particle to absorb the contained energy to your ship, but watch what happens to your energy levels carefully! Different colored particles have varying and unknown energy content and can cause your ship's energy to deplete faster or more slowly. Try to learn which colors charge up your energy the most without accelerating the depletion of your energy (Colors will vary from game to game).

If you fail to maintain your nano-ship’s energy level, your nano-ship will be doomed to decohere and collapse into the void of churning quantum foam. 
 
Win Condition

As you pass maximum energy, look for the spinning overcharge display. Once overcharged, your energy will deplete faster than before. Pass maximum energy a second time to supercharge your energy, which will automatically open a quantum tunnel and return your ship to normal sized space.
